 bio: "I am a photographer and videographer living in Brooklyn. My explorations are a side effect of my curiosity and deep enjoyment of the art and science of photography. This gallery is composed by cyanotypes on glass, digital pictures, film scans and platinum prints. Click on my photo below to visit my Flickr page."
